HOW TO PLAY:
This is a small build of a concept our team had for
a game called "The Divine Adventure". This build
includes all the basic gameplay functions we had
planned to implement.

Choose your hero and fight against a horde of demons
as you try to reach the end of the level.

Get a better score by fighting as many demons as you
can, but watch that health bar!

# The-Divine-Adventure
## !!NOTICE!!
This project was carried on by Christopher Adkins after the end of CSC 316, [You can find his work here](https://github.com/ChrisA98/The-Divine-Adventure).
## Final Group Project for CSC 316.

The Divine Adventure is a shoot â€™em up adventure through the underworld where
the player selects one of four adventurers to fight demons. They are guided along this
journey by a divine being who is enlisting their help to bring an end to the seven deadly
sins.

This project was made in Monogame by a team of 3 developers, originally planned to be a team of 4. It is a short demonstration of our work creating a 3D game with a framework rather than an engine.
